# Model Context Protocol (MCP) Research

## What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open-source protocol developed by Anthropic that enables AI systems like Claude to securely connect with various data sources and tools. It provides a standardized interface that allows Large Language Models (LLMs) to:

- Access external data sources and tools beyond their built-in knowledge
- Interact with specific data sources or tools through a consistent API
- Receive responses in a standardized format optimized for LLM consumption

MCP works through a client-server architecture where:
- **MCP Servers** expose data, tools, and prompts through the protocol
- **MCP Clients** (like Claude, Cursor, WindSurf, Cline, Cherry Studio, HyperChat, Zed code editor, or custom applications) connect to these servers to access their capabilities

According to [Cloudflare's documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agents/concepts/tools/#model-context-protocol-mcp), MCP defines a consistent interface for:
- **Tool Discovery**: Systems can dynamically discover available tools
- **Parameter Validation**: Tools specify their input requirements using JSON Schema
- **Error Handling**: Standardized error reporting and recovery
- **State Management**: Tools can maintain state across invocations

Official docs: https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction

## Which Problem Does MCP Solve?

MCP addresses several critical challenges in the AI ecosystem, e.g:

- **Context Window Limitations**: LLMs have finite context windows, so MCP servers allow them to access data beyond their built-in knowledge
- **Up-to-date Information**: They provide access to real-time or current data that wasn't available during model training
- **Private Data Access**: They enable secure access to private or proprietary information
- **Tool Use**: They allow LLMs to use external tools and services
- **Standardization**: They provide a consistent interface across different data sources
- **Security**: Servers control their own resources, with no need to share API keys with LLM providers
- **System Boundaries**: Maintains clear boundaries and separation of concerns between LLMs and external systems

## Why Should We Use MCP Instead of Building Custom Integrations?

Using MCP instead of custom integrations offers several significant advantages, e.g:

- **Standardization**: MCP provides a consistent interface, reducing the need to learn multiple APIs
- **Compatibility**: Applications built for MCP can work with any MCP-compatible client or server
- **Reduced Development Time**: No need to build and maintain custom integration code
- **Future-Proofing**: As the protocol evolves, our server implementation remains compatible without major changes
- **No Vendor Lock-in**: The open standard means you're not tied to any specific LLM provider
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between LLM functionality and external systems

## Client Integration

Understanding how clients integrate with MCP servers is essential for grasping the full ecosystem.

MCP clients typically integrate with servers through these common patterns, e.g:

1. **Direct SDK Integration**: Applications embed MCP client SDKs directly to connect to MCP servers
2. **AI Agent Framework Integration**: AI agent frameworks connect to MCP servers to extend agent capabilities
3. **LLM Application Plugins**: LLM applications like Claude Desktop and Cursor support MCP servers as plugins

### TypeScript/JavaScript Integration Example

```typescript
import { createClient } from '@modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk';

// Initialize the MCP client
const client = createClient({
  baseUrl: 'https://api.storacha.ai/mcp',
  // Optional authentication
  auth: {
    type: 'bearer',
    token: process.env.STORACHA_API_KEY
  }
});

// List available resources
const resources = await client.resources.list();
console.log('Available resources:', resources);

// Upload a file to Storacha
const uploadResult = await client.tools.invoke('upload', {
  file: new Blob([fileData], { type: 'application/octet-stream' }),
  name: 'example-document.pdf'
});
console.log('File uploaded with CID:', uploadResult.cid);

// Retrieve a file by CID
const retrieveResult = await client.tools.invoke('retrieve', {
  cid: 'bafybeigdyrzt5sfp7udm7hu76uh7y26nf3efuylqabf3oclgtqy55fbzdi'
});
console.log('Retrieved file data:', retrieveResult);
```

### LLM Application Integration (Claude)

Claude and similar LLM applications can access Storacha through their native MCP integration e.g:

1. Users install and configure the Storacha MCP server
2. The LLM application discovers the Storacha server and its capabilities
3. Users can then prompt the LLM to interact with their Storacha storage:

Example prompt:
```sh
Please upload this PDF to my Storacha storage and then list all my stored files.
```

Claude would then:
1. Recognize the task requires Storacha access
2. Use its MCP integration to connect to the Storacha server
3. Upload the file and list stored files using the MCP API
4. Return results to the user

### Integration with AI Agents

For autonomous AI agents, Storacha can serve as persistent memory:

```typescript
// Agent setup with Storacha integration
const agent = new Agent({
  llm: new Claude(),
  tools: [
    // Register Storacha as a memory tool
    {
      name: 'memory',
      description: 'Store and retrieve agent memory',
      connector: createMCPConnector({
        serverUrl: 'https://api.storacha.ai/mcp',
        authToken: process.env.STORACHA_API_KEY
      })
    }
  ]
});

// Agent can now read/write to Storacha
await agent.run(`
  1. Save my current context to persistent memory
  2. Retrieve my previous analysis about climate data
  3. Update my knowledge base with these new findings
`);
```

### Multi-Agent Collaboration via Storacha

Storacha can facilitate data sharing between multiple agents, e.g:

```typescript
// Agent A generates data
const analysisResults = {
  findings: "Temperature patterns show 1.5°C increase over 50 years",
  data: [/* time series data */],
  charts: [/* chart data */],
  timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
};

// Agent A stores data into Storacha
const resultCid = await agentA.tools.invoke("memory.store", {
  data: analysisResults,
  metadata: {
    type: "analysis", 
    topic: "climate-patterns",
    created: new Date().toISOString()
  },
});

console.log(`Data stored with CID: ${resultCid}`);

// --------------------------------------------
// Later, in a different context or application
// --------------------------------------------

// Agent B retrieves data shared by Agent A
try {
  const sharedData = await agentB.tools.invoke("memory.retrieve", {
    cid: resultCid
  });
  
  console.log("Retrieved shared analysis:", sharedData);
  
  // Agent B can now build upon Agent A's work
  await agentB.tools.invoke("memory.store", {
    data: {
      originalAnalysis: resultCid,
      extendedFindings: "Further analysis shows regional variations...",
      additionalData: [/* more data */]
    },
    metadata: {
      type: "extended-analysis",
      basedOn: resultCid,
      topic: "regional-climate-patterns"
    }
  });
} catch (error) {
  console.error("Failed to retrieve shared data:", error);
  // Handle permission issues or missing data
}
```

This TypeScript example demonstrates how multiple agents can share and build upon each other's data through Storacha. We can use UCAN-based permissions to ensure that only authorized agents can access shared resources, while the content-addressing (CIDs) guarantees data integrity across agent interactions.

## Potential Challenges and Considerations

While implementing an MCP server for Storacha offers significant advantages, it's important to consider potential challenges and limitations.

### Implementation and Maintenance Costs

1. **Ongoing Maintenance**: The MCP standard is still evolving, which may require ongoing updates to maintain compatibility
2. **Testing Overhead**: Supporting multiple clients and ensuring consistent behavior adds testing complexity

### Ecosystem Risks

1. **Adoption Uncertainty**: While growing rapidly, MCP's long-term adoption trajectory is still uncertain
2. **Protocol Evolution**: Changes to the MCP standard could require significant updates to Storacha's MCP server implementation
3. **Client Dependencies**: Heavy reliance on specific MCP clients like Claude creates dependencies on their continued support

### Business Considerations

1. **ROI Timeline**: The return on investment might take time to materialize as the MCP ecosystem matures
2. **Market Fragmentation**: If competing protocols emerge, resources could be split between supporting multiple standards
3. **Differentiation Challenges**: If MCP becomes widely adopted across the distributed storage industry (which is likely given its growing popularity), simply supporting MCP would no longer be a unique selling point for Storacha (Access Controlled Data, Mutability, Encryption)
